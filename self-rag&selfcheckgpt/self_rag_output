CEO Steve Jobs to the company's engineers, asking them to investigate the use of touchscreen devices and tablet computers (which later came to fruition with the iPad). Many have noted the device's similarities to Apple's previous touch-screen portable device, the Newton MessagePad. Like the MessagePad, the iPhone is nearly all screen. Its form factor is credited to Apple's Chief Design Officer, Jonathan Ive. The iPhone beta was created in 2004 to test the commands of the Apple team, and while technically may have first iPhone ever created, it was never released to the public, so this beta was not considered the true first iPhone. After some trial and error, the first iPhone was officially launched and made accessible to the public in 2007, and this iPhone and was advertised noticeably at the Macworld of that same year. In this first release, the iPhone was accessible in the US, UK, Canada, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Finland, France, Spain, Italy and South Africa.",
