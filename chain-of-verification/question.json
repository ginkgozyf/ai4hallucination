        "context": "In Australia , the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title is referred to as native title , which is `` the recognition by Australian law that Indigenous people have rights and interests to their land that come from their traditional laws and customs '' . The concept recognises that in certain cases there was and is a continued beneficial legal interest in land held by local Indigenous Australians which survived the acquisition of radical title to the land by the Crown at the time of sovereignty . Native title can co-exist with non-Indigenous proprietary rights and in some cases different Indigenous groups can exercise their native title over the same land . The foundational case for native title in Australia was Mabo v Queensland ( No 2 ) ( 1992 ) . One year after the recognition of the legal concept of native title in Mabo , the Keating Government formalised the recognition by legislation with the enactment by the Australian Parliament of the Native Title Act 1993 . The Act attempted to clarify the legal position of landholders and the processes to be followed for native title to be claimed , protected and recognised through the courts . The Federal Court of Australia mediates claims made by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and hears applications for , and makes , native title determinations . Appeals against these determinations can be made to a full sitting of the Federal Court and then to the High Court of Australia . The National Native Title Tribunal ( NNTT ) , established under the Native Title Act 1993 , is a body that applies the ' registration test ' to all new native title claimant applications , and undertakes future act mediation and arbitral functions .",

            "target_answer": "The development of law relating to native title in Australia has been marked by several key events:\n\n1. **Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)**: This landmark case, decided by the High Court of Australia, recognized the legal concept of native title. The court ruled that the Meriam people of the Torres Strait were entitled to possession, occupation, use, and enjoyment of their traditional lands, effectively overturning the notion of *terra nullius* (land belonging to no one) and acknowledging that Indigenous Australians had a form of land tenure that could coexist with the Crown's sovereignty.\n\n2. **Enactment of the Native Title Act 1993**: One year after the Mabo decision, the Keating Government formalized the recognition of native title through legislation. The Native Title Act 1993 provided a framework for the recognition and protection of native title, as well as processes for claiming, protecting, and recognizing native title through the courts.\n\n3. **Wik Peoples v Queensland (1996)**: In this case, the High Court determined that native title could coexist with pastoral leases, which are leases over large areas of land primarily used for grazing. This decision was significant because it clarified the relationship between native title and other forms of land tenure, particularly pastoral leases, and affirmed that native title rights could be exercised even on leased land, provided they did not conflict with the rights of the leaseholder.\n\n4. **Amendments to the Native Title Act 1998 (Howard Government Reforms)**: Following the Wik decision, the Howard Government made significant amendments to the Native Title Act in 1998. These amendments, known as the \"Ten Point Plan,\" aimed to clarify and limit the scope of native title, particularly in relation to pastoral leases and other forms of land tenure. The changes included provisions for the extinguishment of native title in certain circumstances and the establishment of a \"right to negotiate\" process for future acts affecting native title.\n\n5. **Western Australia v Ward (2002)**: This case involved the High Court's interpretation of the Native Title Act 1993, particularly in relation to the extinguishment of native title. The court held that native title could be partially extinguished by the grant of a pastoral lease, but that some native title rights could still exist, such as the right to hunt, fish, and gather. This decision further refined the understanding of how native title interacts with other forms of land tenure.\n\nThese key events have shaped the legal landscape of native title in Australia, providing a framework for the recognition, protection, and coexistence of Indigenous land rights with other forms of land tenure.",

The High Court of Australia recognized that Indigenous people have rights and interests to their land that come from their traditional laws and customs, effectively overturning the doctrine of *terra nullius* (land belonging to no one).

                "The development of the law relating to native title in Australia has been marked by several key events. Based on the provided context, these are some of the most significant milestones:\n\n1. **Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)**: This is the foundational case for native title in Australia. The High Court of Australia recognized that Indigenous Australians had a pre-existing system of land ownership and use, which could survive the acquisition of sovereignty by the British Crown. This decision overturned the previous legal doctrine of *terra nullius* (land belonging to no one), which had denied the existence of any form of prior ownership by Indigenous peoples.\n\n2. **Native Title Act 1993**: One year after the Mabo decision, the Keating Government formalized the recognition of native title through the enactment of the Native Title Act 1993. This legislation aimed to clarify the legal position of landholders and the processes for claiming, protecting, and recognizing native title through the courts. It also established the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) to handle various aspects of native title claims.\n\n3. **Role of the Federal Court of Australia**: The Federal Court of Australia plays a crucial role in mediating claims made by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, hearing applications for native title, and making determinations. Appeals against these determinations can be made to a full sitting of the Federal Court and then to the High Court of Australia.\n\n4. **National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT)**: Established under the Native Title Act 1993, the NNTT applies the \"registration test\" to all new native title claimant applications. It also undertakes future act mediation and arbitral functions, ensuring that the rights and interests of Indigenous people are protected when dealing with actions that may affect their native title.\n\nThese events and institutions have been pivotal in shaping the legal framework for native title in Australia, providing a pathway for Indigenous Australians to assert and protect their traditional rights and interests in land.",

However , after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 , the District was unable to raise the construction funds , so it lobbied for a $30 million bond measure . The bonds were approved in November 1930 , by votes in the counties affected by the bridge . The construction budget at the time of approval was $27 million . However , the District was unable to sell the bonds until 1932 , when Amadeo Giannini , the founder of San Francisco -- based Bank of America , agreed on behalf of his bank to buy the entire issue in order to help the local economy . Construction began on January 5 , 1933 . The project cost more than $35 million , ( $493 million in 2016 dollars ) completing ahead of schedule and $1.3 million under budget . The Golden Gate Bridge construction project was carried out by the McClintic - Marshall Construction Co. , a subsidiary of Bethlehem Steel Corporation founded by Howard H. McClintic and Charles D. Marshall , both of Lehigh University . Strauss remained head of the project , overseeing day - to - day construction and making some groundbreaking contributions . A graduate of the University of Cincinnati , he placed a brick from his alma mater 's demolished McMicken Hall in the south anchorage before the concrete was poured . He innovated the use of movable safety netting beneath the construction site , which saved the lives of many otherwise - unprotected ironworkers . Of eleven men killed from falls during construction , ten were killed on February 17 , 1937 , when the bridge was near completion when the net failed under the stress of a scaffold that had fallen . The workers ' platform that was attached to a rolling hanger on a track collapsed when the bolts that were connected to the track were too small and the amount of weight was too great to bear . The platform fell into the safety net , but was too heavy and the net gave way . Two out of the twelve workers survived the 200 - foot ( 61 m ) fall into the icy waters , including the 37 - year - old foreman , Slim Lambert . Nineteen others who were saved by the net over the course of construction became members of their Half Way to Hell Club .",

Over the years , events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System . The U.S. Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act : maximizing employment , stabilizing prices , and moderating long - term interest rates . The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve 's dual mandate . Its duties have expanded over the years , and as of 2009 also include supervising and regulating banks , maintaining the stability of the financial system and providing financial services to depository institutions , the U.S. government , and foreign official institutions .

In the United States , at least three political cultures took root during the colonial period . They were formed in New England by religious refugees from England , in the Mid-Atlantic region by Dutch settlers , in Virginia by English adventurers seeking fortune in the New World , and in Carolina by English investors who envisioned a model constitutional society . In Virginia and Carolina , and later elsewhere in the South , Scots - Irish settlers influenced the cultural hearth that created the American South . Each began with established cultures of the British Isles and the Netherlands , evolving into unique cultures that remain in existence today in the United States . The political scientist Daniel J. Elazar identified three primary political cultures , generally consistent with those of Tocqueville . Moralistic political culture evolved out of New England and is characterized by an emphasis of community and civic virtue over individualism . Individualistic political culture arose from Dutch influence in the Mid-Atlantic region ; it regards multiculturalism as a practicality and government as a utilitarian necessity . Traditionalistic political culture arose in the South , which elevates social order and family structure to a prominent role . It accepts a natural hierarchy in society and where necessary to protect society , authoritarian leadership in the political and religious realms . The formation of traditionalistic political culture is often thought to have arisen principally out of Virginia , the first and most populous southern colony . Virginia was also the most politically powerful state after the Revolution : pursuant to the first census of the United States in 1790 it held a greater percentage of congressional representatives than any other state has ever enjoyed up to the present day . Nevertheless , others argue that South Carolina had the greater influence as a result of its Grand Model enabling slaveholders from Barbados to establish a durable aristocracy . That unique convergence produced a slave society with a majority black population rigidly controlled by the plantation elite . Maintaining such a society required intense political resolve and the development of a mythology of white racial supremacy . The South Carolina hybrid model ultimately spread across the Deep South and was unwavering in its promotion of southern culture , whereas Virginia and other Upper South states were less comfortable with the region 's `` peculiar institution '' of slavery .",

Harris himself , born in 1848 , was a racial reconciliation activist writer and journalist of the Reconstruction Era . The film makes several indirect references to the Reconstruction Era : clothing is in the newer late - Victorian style ; Uncle Remus is free to leave the plantation at will ; black field hands are sharecroppers , etc . 7 - year - old Johnny ( Bobby Driscoll ) is excited about what he believes to be a vacation at his grandmother 's Georgia plantation with his parents , John Sr. ( Erik Rolf ) and Sally ( Ruth Warrick ) .

Its main purpose is to serve as the stage of the royal procession at State Openings of Parliament , which the audience watch from temporary tiered seating on both sides of the route . It has also been used on occasion by visiting statesmen from abroad when addressing both Houses of Parliament , as well as for receptions in honour of foreign dignitaries , and more regularly for the Lord Chancellor 's Breakfast ; in the past it was the theatre of several trials of peers by the House of Lords . Documents from the Parliamentary Archives are on display in the Royal Gallery ( including a facsimile of Charles I 's death warrant ) , and the tables and seating offer a workspace for members of the Lords that is conveniently close to their debating chamber . The decorative scheme of the Royal Gallery was meant to display important moments in British military history , and the walls are decorated by two large paintings by Daniel Maclise , each measuring 13.7 by 3.7 metres ( 45 by 12 ft ) : The Death of Nelson ( depicting Lord Nelson 's demise at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 ) and The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher ( showing the Duke of Wellington meeting Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 ) . The murals deteriorated rapidly after their completion due to a range of factors , most importantly atmospheric pollution , and today they are almost monochrome . The rest of the planned frescos were cancelled , and the walls are filled with portraits of kings and queens from George I onwards . Another decorative element with military undertones are the eight statues of gilded Caen stone that flank the three doorways and the bay window of the Gallery , sculpted by John Birnie Philip . Each depicts a monarch during whose reign a key battle or war took place . They are : Alfred the Great and William the Conqueror ; Richard I and Edward III ; Henry V and Elizabeth I ; William III and Anne . The panelled ceiling , 13.7 metres ( 45 ft ) above the floor , features Tudor roses and lions , and the stained - glass windows show the coats of arms of the Kings of England and Scotland . The Prince 's Chamber is a small anteroom between the Royal Gallery and the Lords Chamber , named after the room adjoining the Parliament Chamber in the Old Palace of Westminster . Thanks to its location , it is a place where members of the Lords meet to discuss business of the House .

        "context": "Initiation of translation in prokaryotes involves the assembly of the components of the translation system , which are : the two ribosomal subunits ( 50S and 30S subunits ) ; the mature mRNA to be translated ; the tRNA charged with N - formylmethionine ( the first amino acid in the nascent peptide ) ; guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) as a source of energy , and the three prokaryotic initiation factors IF1 , IF2 , and IF3 , which help the assembly of the initiation complex . Variations in the mechanism can be anticipated . The ribosome has three active sites : the A site , the P site , and the E site . The A site is the point of entry for the aminoacyl tRNA ( except for the first aminoacyl tRNA , which enters at the P site ) . The P site is where the peptidyl tRNA is formed in the ribosome . And the E site which is the exit site of the now uncharged tRNA after it gives its amino acid to the growing peptide chain . The selection of an initiation site ( usually an AUG codon ) depends on the interaction between the 30S subunit and the mRNA template . The 30S subunit binds to the mRNA template at a purine - rich region ( the Shine - Dalgarno sequence ) upstream of the AUG initiation codon . The Shine - Dalgarno sequence is complementary to a pyrimidine rich region on the 16S rRNA component of the 30S subunit . This sequence has been evolutionarily conserved and plays a major role in the microbial world we know today . During the formation of the initiation complex , these complementary nucleotide sequences pair to form a double stranded RNA structure that binds the mRNA to the ribosome in such a way that the initiation codon is placed at the P site .",
