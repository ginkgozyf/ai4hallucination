        "final_answer": "All listed events are confirmed as key developments in Australian native title law. The refined answer is:\n\n1. **Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)** – The High Court recognized that Indigenous Australians held native title prior to British colonization, overturning the doctrine of terra nullius.  \n2. **Native Title Act 1993 (Cth)** – Enacted in response to Mabo, this legislation established a national framework for claiming and protecting native title.  \n3. **Wik Peoples v Queensland (1996)** – The High Court held that native title could coexist with pastoral leases, clarifying the relationship between native title and other land interests.  \n4. **1998 Native Title Amendment Act (Cth)** – Also known as the “10 Point Plan,” this amendment significantly modified the Native Title Act, largely in response to the Wik decision.  \n5. **Yorta Yorta v Victoria (2002)** – The High Court ruled that native title requires continuous acknowledgment and observance of traditional laws and customs since sovereignty, setting a high evidentiary bar for claimants.  \n6. **Northern Territory v Mr Griffiths and Lorraine Jones (2019)** – The High Court awarded the first-ever compensation for economic loss due to extinguishment of native title, establishing important principles for future compensation claims.  \n7. **Akiba v Commonwealth (2013)** – The High Court recognized native title rights over sea areas and clarified that regulation of an activity (e.g., fishing) does not necessarily extinguish native title rights.",

        "final_answer": "Final Refined Answer:  \nYou have the right to remain silent:\n\n1. **Upon arrest** – In the United States, law enforcement must inform you of this right (as part of your Miranda rights) once you are taken into custody.  \n2. **During police interrogation** – You may refuse to answer questions, and if you clearly invoke your right to remain silent, questioning must stop.  \n3. **In custodial settings** – The right applies specifically when you are in police custody and subject to interrogation, as established by *Miranda v. Arizona* (1966).  \n4. **Whenever invoking your Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination** – This constitutional right allows you to remain silent in any situation where your statements could be used against you in a criminal case.\n\nNote: While the core protections stem from the U.S. Constitution, the specifics may vary by jurisdiction. In some places, you may still be required to provide basic identifying information even when exercising your right to remain silent.",
